# Instacart-Basket-Analys-Nhung Pham
## I. Project Summary
This repository contains initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data, with a focus on uncovering customer purchasing patterns. As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery platform, the objective is to derive insights that will inform a targeted marketing strategy. The analysis explores the variety of customers in the database and their buying behaviors, aiming to identify distinct customer segments. These insights will help Instacart tailor its marketing campaigns to effectively reach and influence the right customer profiles, ultimately optimizing product sales.
